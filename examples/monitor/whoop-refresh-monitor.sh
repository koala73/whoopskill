# whoop-refresh-monitor.sh
#
# Purpose:
# - Prevent silent failures when running whoopskill from cron/systemd by proactively refreshing tokens.
# - Optionally emits a simple health snapshot to confirm the API is reachable.
#
# Requires:
# - whoopskill installed and authenticated at least once: `whoopskill auth login`
# - WHOOP_CLIENT_ID / WHOOP_CLIENT_SECRET / WHOOP_REDIRECT_URI configured (env or .env)
#
# Notes:
# - This script does NOT re-run the browser login flow. If refresh fails due to expired refresh token,
#   you must run: `whoopskill auth login`
